 * WARNING: Do NOT use these callbacks to draw!  You cannot draw during flight 
 * loop callbacks.  Use the drawing callbacks (see XPLMDisplay for more info)

/*
 * XPLMFlightLoop_f
 * 
 * This is your flight loop callback.  Each time the flight loop is iterated 
 * through, you receive this call at the end.  You receive a time since you 
 * were last called and a time since the last loop, as well as a loop counter. 
 * The 'phase' parameter is deprecated and should be ignored.				 
 * 
 * Your return value controls when you will next be called. Return 0 to stop 
 * receiving callbacks.  Pass a positive number to specify how many seconds 
 * until the next callback.  (You will be called at or after this time, not 
 * before.)  Pass a negative number to specify how many loops must go by until 
 * you are called.  For example, -1.0 means call me the very next loop.  Try 
 * to run your flight loop as infrequently as is practical, and suspend it 
 * (using return value 0) when you do not need it; lots of flight loop 
 * callbacks that do nothing lowers x-plane's frame rate. 
 * 
 * Your callback will NOT be unregistered if you return 0; it will merely be 
 * inactive. 
 * 
 * The reference constant you passed to your loop is passed back to you.
