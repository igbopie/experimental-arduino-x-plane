   This API allows you to get regular callbacks during the flight loop, the 
   part of X-Plane where the plane's position calculates the physics of 
   flight, etc.  Use these APIs to accomplish periodic tasks like logging data 
   and performing I/O. 
   
   WARNING: Do NOT use these callbacks to draw!  You cannot draw during flight 
   loop callbacks.  Use the drawing callbacks (see XPLMDisplay for more info) 
   for graphics.

   {
    XPLMFlightLoop_f
    
    This is your flight loop callback.  Each time the flight loop is iterated 
    through, you receive this call at the end.  You receive a time since you 
    were last called and a time since the last loop, as well as a loop counter. 
    The 'phase' parameter is deprecated and should be ignored.				 
    
    Your return value controls when you will next be called. Return 0 to stop 
    receiving callbacks.  Pass a positive number to specify how many seconds 
    until the next callback.  (You will be called at or after this time, not 
    before.)  Pass a negative number to specify how many loops must go by until 
    you are called.  For example, -1.0 means call me the very next loop.  Try 
    to run your flight loop as infrequently as is practical, and suspend it 
    (using return value 0) when you do not need it; lots of flight loop 
    callbacks that do nothing lowers x-plane's frame rate. 
    
    Your callback will NOT be unregistered if you return 0; it will merely be 
    inactive. 
    
    The reference constant you passed to your loop is passed back to you.

    This routine returns the elapsed time since the sim started up in decimal

    XPLMRegisterFlightLoopCallback
    
    This routine registers your flight loop callback.  Pass in a pointer to a 
    flight loop function and a refcon.  inInterval defines when you will be 
    called.  Pass in a positive number to specify seconds from registration 
    time to the next callback. Pass in a negative number to indicate when you 
    will be called (e.g. pass -1 to be called at the next cylcle).  Pass 0 to 
    not be called; your callback will be inactive.

    This routine unregisters your flight loop callback.  Do NOT call it from

    This routine sets when a callback will be called.  Do NOT call it from your 
    callback; use the return value of the callback to change your callback 
    interval from inside your callback. 
    
    inInterval is formatted the same way as in XPLMRegisterFlightLoopCallback; 
    positive for seconds, negative for cycles, and 0 for deactivating the 
    callback.  If  inRelativeToNow is 1, times are from the time of this call; 
    otherwise they are from the time the callback was last called (or the time 
    it was registered if it has never been called.
